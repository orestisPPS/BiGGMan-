1)Create Finite Difference implementation with input error order (up to 4?)

2)Calculate metrix

3)Search for gnuplot addon

4)Check if all destructors are implemented correctly up to this point (steady state fd analysis test)
    (nodes,dofs ->with their ids, mathematical objects etc)
    


------------------------ROAD TO LAPLACE EQUATION------------------------
1)Fix bug in neighbour finder.
2)Check if the produced matrix for 1-2-1 fd scheme is correct (check with c#) 
3)Create RHS vector
4)Implement Dirichlet BCs (leave Neumann for later)
5)Implement solver (LU decomposition - Jacobi)
