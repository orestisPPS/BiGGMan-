1)Insert Boundary Values To Nodes
   ii. Create DOF at nodes 
   iii.Create BoundaryCreator Class for 2D

2)Create Finite Difference implementation with input error order (up to 4?)

3)Calculate metrix

4)Search for gnuplot addon

5)Create Simulation Class

6) About node -> dof transformation. Search all domain boundaries nodes and the corresponding boundary conditions. Then, create a new dof for each no
    if it is dirichlet assign the value to the dof else assign the dof to the free nodes list.
    Then iterate over all the internal nodes and assign their dofs to the free nodes list.
    Finally organize the list of the free dofs with respect to the node global id.
